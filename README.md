# Poké @ Home

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/agoldenduck/poke-at-home.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/agoldenduck/poke-at-home)

Poké @ Home is a little experiment based on a code challenge I was set using [Lucas Bento's Pokemon GraphQL server](https://github.com/lucasbento/graphql-pokemon).

[Try demo](https://pokemonhome.netlify.com/)

It's a statically hosted site that connects to the GraphQL server and sorts the pokemon based on your decription of your home.
 
It allowed me to play with the following techs:

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui-next.com/)
* [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
* [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/)
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
* [JSS](http://cssinjs.org/)

What I'd like to achieve on this project

- [x] sort Pokemon by suitability to user home
- [x] build mobile first interface
- [ ] simulate a store-like interface with home page, results page, and item pages
- [ ] locally store the user's home and favourite pokemon
- [ ] share your favourites and your results
- [ ] track results, favourites, and suggestions
- [ ] host assets through React Storybook
- [ ] write component tests
